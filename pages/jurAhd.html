                              Planning your pregnancy is important because it helps ensure that both you 
                              and your baby are healthy. When pregnancies are planned, there is a better 
                              chance of having a healthy baby. Planning allows you to take steps to get 
                              yourself in good health before getting pregnant and to receive regular 
                              medical care throughout your pregnancy, which is called prenatal care. 
                              Prenatal care is important for the well-being of both you and your baby.

                                planning your pregnancy is just as important as anywhere else. By 
                                making a reproductive life plan, you can think about when and if 
                                you want to have a baby. Consider how many children you want and 
                                how far apart you'd like them to be.<br><br>Before getting pregnant, 
                                it's crucial to focus on your health. Make sure you are in good 
                                physical condition to have a healthy pregnancy and baby. If you're 
                                sexually active but not ready for a baby right now, it's essential 
                                to use effective contraception or birth control to avoid unplanned 
                                pregnancies.<br><br>Talk openly with your partner about your 
                                reproductive life plan. Remember that there are no right or wrong 
                                answers, and your plans may change as you both get older. It's okay 
                                if you don't agree on everything at first; take some time to discuss 
                                and decide together.<br><br>To prevent pregnancies until you are 
                                ready, explore the various <br><br>birth control options available in 
                                Sri Lanka. These could include intrauterine devices (IUDs), 
                                implants, the pill, or condoms. Speak with a healthcare provider 
                                who can help you choose the best birth control method for you and 
                                your partner's needs.<br><br>By planning your pregnancy and taking 
                                care of your health, you can increase the chances of having a healthy 
                                baby and a positive pregnancy experience.

                                Becoming a parent brings significant changes to your life. 
                                Before having a baby, it's important to have a conversation

                                This checkup ensures that you're in good health and ready for pregnancy. If you're not ready yet,

                                        income. See how much money is left after paying your bills. You may

                               Before you get pregnant, there are important steps you can take 
                               to ensure a healthy pregnancy for you and your future baby. One 
                               of the first things you can do is visit a doctor or a local 
                               healthcare center, for pre-pregnancy care.<br><br>
                               During pre-pregnancy care, the doctor or nurse will assess your overall 
                               health and address any concerns that may affect your pregnancy. They will 
                               ask you questions about your medical history, family medical history, 
                               current health issues, diet, lifestyle, and medications or supplements 
                               you may be taking. They will also discuss your pregnancy history, 
                               safety at home and work, and any mental health concerns.<br><br>
                               As part of your pre-pregnancy care, the doctor may recommend a visit 
                               to the dentist for a checkup. Treating any gum disease before pregnancy 
                               can help prevent health problems for both you and your future baby.<br><br>
                               Pre-pregnancy visits are an excellent opportunity to ask any questions 
                               you may have, so make sure to come prepared with any concerns or uncertainties 
                               you want to discuss. The healthcare provider will provide guidance and tips on 
                               how to improve your chances of getting pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy.

                                 Having a high-risk pregnancy is uncommon, so there's no need to worry too much. 
                                 While some things during pregnancy are beyond your control and can happen randomly, 
                                 there are steps you can take to minimize risks and ensure a healthy pregnancy.<br><br>
                                 Getting pre-pregnancy care from a healthcare provider, such as a nurse, doctor, 
                                 or local health center like Planned Parenthood, before getting pregnant is 
                                 important. Additionally, attending regular prenatal care visits throughout 
                                 your pregnancy can help lower the chances of having a high-risk pregnancy.<br><br>
                                 Certain conditions or factors can make pregnancy more challenging. 
                                 If you have high blood pressure, heart or kidney disease, chronic 
                                 conditions like diabetes or lupus, a history of miscarriages or premature 
                                 births, or if you're aware of a risk of birth defects or genetic disorders, 
                                 it becomes even more crucial to seek pre-pregnancy care.<br><br>
                                 Other factors that may require extra attention include having a sexually 
                                 transmitted infection, being underweight or overweight, or being older than 35.
                                 <br><br>By receiving appropriate care and monitoring, you can increase the 
                                 likelihood of a healthy and successful pregnancy. Remember, it's important 
                                 to consult with a healthcare provider who can provide personalized advice 
                                 based on your specific situation.

                                Your partner can play a significant role in planning your pregnancy if

                                helpful, especially if you're making lifestyle changes to prepare for 
                                pregnancy.<br><br>
                                It's important to consider your partner's health as well when it comes 
                                to getting pregnant. Certain factors can lower sperm count and affect 
                                semen quality, making it more difficult to conceive. These factors include 
                                drinking alcohol, smoking or using tobacco, using steroids or illegal drugs, 
                                taking certain prescription drugs or over-the-counter medicines, spending 
                                extended time in hot environments (like hot tubs or saunas), and having an 
                                unhealthy diet.<br><br>
                                Having a conversation with your partner about making healthy lifestyle 
                                choices can benefit both their overall health and increase the chances 
                                of a successful pregnancy in the future. Working together as a team can 
                                help create a supportive and conducive environment for your pregnancy plans.

                               throughout your pregnancy. However, if you prefer to switch to a different 
                               healthcare provider, you can ask for recommendations from friends, family, 
                               or other healthcare professionals. Your local health

                              Ovulation usually occurs around the middle of your menstrual cycle, 
                              which is typically on day 14 of a 28-day cycle. However, this can 
                              vary from woman to woman. As a general rule, ovulation takes place 
                              approximately 13 to 14 days before your next expected period.<br><br>
                              It's important to note that menstrual cycles can vary in length, 
                              ranging from 23 to 35 days, and the timing of ovulation may vary 
                              slightly from month to month. If you have regular and predictable 
                              periods, estimating the time of ovulation is usually straightforward. 
                              However, if your periods are irregular, unpredictable, or occur less 
                              frequently than every 40 days, tracking ovulation can be more challenging.
                               <br><br>To help determine your fertile window and ovulation date, 
                               you can use tools such as the Ovulation Calculator on this web application Mom & Me. 
                               These resources can provide you with an estimate based on the information you

                             Ovulation lasts for a relatively short time. After the release of an egg 
                             from the ovary, it can be fertilized for about 12 to 24 hours. This happens 
                             approximately 12 to 36 hours after a surge in the hormone LH.<br><br>
                             If you're trying to get pregnant, it's best to have intercourse every 
                             other day starting four to five days before the predicted ovulation day 
                             until the day of ovulation. Having sex within this timeframe gives you 
                             the highest chance of conception. However, it is still possible to get 
                             pregnant if you have sex within the 24 hours after predicted ovulation.
                             <br><br>On average, healthy couples who are not using birth control 
                             have a 25 to 30 percent chance of getting pregnant during each monthly 
                             cycle. The likelihood of conception decreases as women reach their mid-30s 
                             and varies based on individual circumstances. Having intercourse on the day 
                             of ovulation improves the odds of getting pregnant. <br><br>
                             It's important to remember that it only takes one sperm to fertilize an egg 
                             and achieve pregnancy. This means that you can still get pregnant if you have 
                             sex up to five days before ovulation or one day after ovulation.

                                LH stands for luteinizing hormone. It is a hormone produced by 
                                the pituitary gland in the brain. LH plays a crucial role in 
                                the menstrual cycle and ovulation.<br><br>During the menstrual 
                                cycle, LH levels rise in a process called the LH surge. This 
                                surge triggers the release of a mature egg from the ovary, 
                                known as ovulation. Ovulation usually occurs around 12 to 
                                36 hours after the LH surge.<br><br>
                                By tracking LH levels, either through ovulation predictor 
                                kits or with the help of medical professionals, women can 
                                determine when they are approaching ovulation. This knowledge 
                                can be helpful for couples who are trying to conceive as it

                                     Keep track of your menstrual cycles for a few months to understand your pattern. 
                                     You can use tools like a menstrual cycle calendar or ovulation calculators to help

                                     Pay attention to signs of ovulation such as light cramps, changes in cervical 
                                     mucus (discharge), breast tenderness, increased libido, mood changes, and other 
                                     physical sensations.</li><br>

                                            Measure your body temperature using a special thermometer each morning before 
                                            getting out of bed. Your BBT may slightly rise after ovulation, indicating that 
                                            you have already ovulated. This method helps you identify ovulation after it happens,

                                                Notice changes in your cervical mucus throughout your cycle. Before ovulation, 
                                                the mucus becomes thinner, clearer, and more slippery, similar to egg whites.

                             Having trouble getting pregnant? One possible reason could be anovulation, 
                             which means your ovaries are not releasing an egg during your menstrual cycle. 
                             If you don't ovulate, you can't conceive during that cycle. The good news is 
                             that there are treatments available to help trigger ovulation and improve your 
                             chances of getting pregnant.<br><br>
                             Anovulation can be caused by different factors such as polycystic ovary 
                             syndrome (PCOS), hormonal imbalances, ovarian insufficiency, high prolactin 
                             levels, or thyroid dysfunction. Symptoms may include irregular periods, 
                             light or heavy bleeding, and other related signs like acne, weight gain, 
                             or abnormal hair growth.
                             <br><br>If you're not ovulating, it can make it difficult to time 
                             intercourse for conception. However, various treatments can help 
                             regulate hormone levels and stimulate ovulation, increasing your 
                             chances of getting pregnant. Medications like clomiphene citrate 
                             or letrozole can be used for PCOS and other conditions. In some cases, 
                             assisted reproductive techniques like in vitro fertilization (IVF) or 
                             using donor eggs may be recommended.<br><br>
                             If you suspect anovulation or have irregular cycles, it's important 
                             to consult with your doctor. They can diagnose the condition, identify 
                             the underlying cause, and recommend appropriate treatments. Don't hesitate 
                             to seek medical advice, as many cases of anovulation can be successfully 
                             treated to improve your chances of conceiving.

                             When a man's sperm meets a woman's egg, it happens in a special place 
                             called the fallopian tubes. The sperm has to swim from the vagina, through 
                             the cervix, and into the uterus to reach the fallopian tubes. If one sperm 
                             successfully joins with the egg, it's called fertilization. Then, the 
                             fertilized egg travels from the fallopian tubes to the uterus, where it 
                             attaches to the uterine wall and starts growing into a baby.<br><br>
                             Sometimes, the fertilized egg may implant and grow in the wrong place, 
                             like the fallopian tube or other areas outside the uterus. This is called 
                             an ectopic pregnancy, which is not safe and needs medical attention.
                             <br><br>So, fertilization happens in the fallopian tubes, and the fertilized 
                             egg then moves to the uterus to develop into a baby, but it's important for 
                             it to be in the right place for a healthy pregnancy.

                               Fertilization occurs during a specific timeframe, usually within a few days 
                               around the time of ovulation. Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary.<br><br>
                               For fertilization to happen, a sperm needs to be present in the fallopian tube 
                               at the same time as the egg. However, even if a sperm reaches the fallopian tube, 
                               it doesn't guarantee fertilization. The timing must be just right, and the sperm 
                               needs to meet the egg during this small window of opportunity. Sometimes, factors 
                               like fertility issues or timing can affect the chances of fertilization.
                               <br><br>It's important to remember that fertilization usually happens in 
                               only one of the fallopian tubes, where the egg is present during a given month.

                             The time when you are most likely to get pregnant is during the 5 days 
                             before ovulation, including the day you ovulate. This is because sperm 
                             can survive inside your body for up to 5 days, so if you have sex during 
                             this time, the sperm can fertilize an egg if it is released.<br><br>After 
                             ovulation, which is when an egg is released from your ovary, the egg can 
                             only survive for about 12 to 24 hours. Once this time has passed, you 
                             cannot get pregnant until your next menstrual cycle begins.
                             <br><br>Your highest chances of getting pregnant occur in the 3 days 
                             leading up to and including the day of ovulation.

                                Fertilization is not an instant process and takes some time. 
                                After sex, it takes about an hour for sperm to reach the egg. 
                                However, the entire fertilization process can take several 
                                hours.<br><br>Initially, after sex, the semen coagulates in 
                                the vagina, forming a barrier that keeps the sperm from 
                                moving too far in the wrong direction. Within 30 minutes, 
                                the semen liquefies, and any sperm that haven't reached the 
                                cervix are eliminated by the vagina's acidity.<br><br>
                                The sperm that make it to the cervical canal undergo changes 
                                and gain the speed needed to swim through the uterus and 
                                fallopian tubes. The cervical mucus becomes more favorable 
                                for sperm movement during fertile times.<br><br>
                                During ovulation, the cervical mucus becomes stretchy, 
                                clear, and thin, helping sperm travel efficiently. The 
                                mucus forms tiny tracks that sperm can ride on to reach 
                                the egg.<br><br>When sperm reach the egg, they face tough 
                                competition from other sperm. Hundreds of sperm surround the 
                                egg, attempting to penetrate its outer layer. Only one sperm 
                                can successfully enter the egg, triggering a chemical reaction 
                                that prevents other sperm from entering. The genetic material 
                                from the sperm and egg then combines, resulting in fertilization.
                                <br><br>Overall, the journey and competition between sperm to 
                                fertilize an egg can take several hours.

                             Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive a pregnancy or 
                             carry a pregnancy to full term after having regular, unprotected 
                             sexual intercourse for at least one year (or six months for women over 35) 
                             without the use of contraception. It is a medical condition that affects 
                             both men and women and can be caused by various factors. <br><br> 
                             In women, infertility may be caused by issues such as hormonal imbalances, 
                             problems with ovulation, blocked fallopian tubes, or structural abnormalities 
                             in the reproductive organs. Age, certain medical conditions (such as polycystic 
                             ovary syndrome or endometriosis), and lifestyle factors (such as smoking, 
                             excessive alcohol consumption, or being significantly underweight or overweight) 
                             can also contribute to female infertility.<br><br> 
                             In men, infertility can result from issues with sperm production, 
                             sperm quality or movement, or blockages that prevent the release of 
                             sperm. Factors such as hormonal imbalances, genetic conditions, certain 
                             medications, and lifestyle choices (like smoking or excessive alcohol use) 
                             can impact male fertility.<br><br> Infertility can be a challenging 
                             and emotionally distressing experience for individuals and couples who 
                             desire to have a child. However, with advancements in medical technology 
                             and fertility treatments, many couples are able to overcome infertility 
                             and achieve a successful pregnancy. If you suspect you or your partner 
                             may be experiencing fertility issues, it is recommended to consult with 
                             a healthcare professional who specializes in reproductive medicine.

                            Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus 
                            grows in other places in the body. It can cause pain and make it harder for a 
                            woman to get pregnant.<br><br>Endometriosis can affect any girl or woman 
                            who menstruates, but it's more common in women in their 30s and 40s. The 
                            exact cause is unknown, but it may be related to hormonal and immune 
                            system issues.
                             <br><br>Some common symptoms of endometriosis include severe period cramps, 
                             lower back or pelvic pain, pain during or after sex, and digestive problems. 
                             It can also cause fertility problems and make it harder to conceive.<br><br>
                             While it can be more challenging to get pregnant with endometriosis, 
                             it's still possible. About 40% of women with infertility issues have 
                             endometriosis. When a woman with endometriosis does get pregnant, she 
                             may have a higher chance of needing a C-section.<br><br>There's no cure 
                             for endometriosis, but treatments are available to manage symptoms and 
                             improve fertility. Medications and surgery can be used to remove growths 
                             and improve the chances of getting pregnant.<br><br>
                             Having endometriosis may increase the risk of certain pregnancy 
                             complications, such as placenta previa, miscarriage, preterm birth, 
                             and preeclampsia. However, with regular prenatal care, many women with 
                             endometriosis go on to have healthy pregnancies and babies.<br><br>
                             If you have concerns about endometriosis and pregnancy, it's important 
                             to talk to your doctor. They can provide guidance and recommend appropriate 
                             treatments to support your reproductive health.

                                Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal condition 
                                that affects ovulation. It can make it more difficult for 
                                women to get pregnant and increases the risk of certain 
                                pregnancy complications.<br><br>PCOS is caused by factors 
                                like genetics, higher levels of male hormones, excess insulin 
                                in the body, and being overweight or obese.<br><br>
                                Common symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstrual cycles, 
                                acne, excessive hair growth, thinning hair, weight gain, 
                                and insulin resistance.<br><br>
                                While there is no cure for PCOS, a healthy lifestyle can help 
                                manage the symptoms. Eating a balanced diet, losing weight if 
                                necessary, and exercising can improve ovulation and regulate 
                                periods.<br><br>Women with PCOS can still get pregnant with 
                                or without the help of medications that promote ovulation or 
                                assisted reproductive techniques like in vitro fertilization (IVF).
                                <br><br>PCOS increases the risk of complications such as miscarriage 
                                and gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Women with PCOS are also 
                                more likely to develop preeclampsia and may have a slightly higher 
                                chance of needing a cesarean section (C-section).<br><br>
                                To increase the chances of getting pregnant with PCOS, medications 
                                like metformin, clomiphene citrate (Clomid), or letrozole (Femara) 
                                can be used to stimulate ovulation. In more severe cases, IVF may 
                                be recommended. <br><br> With proper care and treatment, women 
                                with PCOS can still conceive and have a healthy pregnancy. It's 
                                important to work closely with healthcare professionals to manage 
                                the condition and address any concerns.

                                Uterine fibroids are common growths in the uterus that are 
                                usually harmless. They affect up to 20% of women of childbearing 
                                age and are made of muscle and fibrous tissue.<br><br>
                                Fibroids may cause symptoms like heavy or painful periods, 
                                bloating, frequent urination, and pain during sex. During 
                                pregnancy, they can lead to pain, vaginal bleeding, and 
                                pelvic pressure.<br><br>
                                The exact cause of fibroids is unknown, but hormones and genetics 
                                may play a role. They are more common in Black women and can be 
                                influenced by factors like obesity and diet.<br><br>
                                Fibroids rarely cause fertility issues, but in some cases, 
                                they can make it harder to get pregnant. They can affect 
                                the fallopian tubes, cervix, or uterus, making it difficult 
                                for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Treatment can improve 
                                the chances of conception.<br><br>
                                During pregnancy, fibroids are usually not a problem. 
                                They may grow due to increased hormone levels but often 
                                shrink after giving birth. Fibroids slightly increase the 
                                risk of preterm delivery and may require a C-section.
                                <br><br>Most fibroids don't require treatment during pregnancy 
                                and can be managed with rest and pain medications. Surgery is only 
                                performed in severe cases.<br><br>
                                It's important to keep your doctor informed about fibroids, 
                                especially if you experience symptoms or have fertility concerns. 
                                They can monitor the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.

                                Irregular periods can be a bit unpredictable, with your 
                                menstrual cycles happening at unusual intervals or unpredictable 
                                times. They can be caused by temporary factors like stress, travel, 
                                or changes in your routine. Chronic irregular periods can be due to 
                                factors like weight changes, hormonal imbalances, or conditions like 
                                polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).<br><br>
                                Having irregular periods doesn't always mean you can't get pregnant, 
                                but it can make it harder. When your periods are irregular, it's 
                                difficult to track ovulation and know the best time to try to conceive. 
                                Irregular periods can sometimes indicate a problem with ovulation, which 
                                can affect fertility.<br><br>
                                If you're trying to conceive or if irregular periods bother you, it's a 
                                good idea to see a doctor. They can evaluate your hormone levels and suggest 
                                treatments to regulate your menstrual cycle or address any underlying issues. 
                                Fertility drugs may be recommended if you're trying to get pregnant.<br><br>
                                Having irregular periods doesn't mean you can't have a healthy pregnancy and 
                                baby. Whether you're trying to conceive or not, it's important to consult 
                                with your doctor to ensure nothing is being missed and to discuss the best 
                                options for you.

                                Infertility can be a challenge for couples trying to have a baby, 
                                and it's not just a problem for women. Men can also experience 
                                fertility issues. In fact, about one-third of infertility cases are 
                                due to male factors.<br><br>
                                Male infertility can be caused by various factors. It could be 
                                because the man's body doesn't produce enough sperm, the sperm doesn't 
                                function properly, or there is a blockage preventing the sperm from 
                                reaching the egg. These issues can be related to health conditions, 
                                hormonal imbalances, certain medications, lifestyle factors like smoking 
                                or obesity, and exposure to toxins.<br><br>
                                Getting a diagnosis for male infertility usually involves a semen analysis, 
                                where the sperm is examined for count, shape, and movement. Further tests may 
                                be recommended to determine the underlying cause.<br><br>
                                Male infertility can affect a couple's ability to conceive if the sperm is not 
                                able to fertilize the egg. However, with some treatment options, such as 
                                surgery or medication, fertility can be improved. Assisted reproductive 
                                therapies like intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization may also 
                                be used. Lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking or losing weight, can 
                                also make a difference. <br><br>
                                It's important to remember that many couples dealing with male infertility 
                                are still able to conceive, either naturally or with the help of treatments. 
                                Seeking medical advice and discussing the available options with a healthcare 
                                professional is recommended for couples facing male infertility.

                                In Sri Lanka, there are various treatments available for fertility issues. 
                                Here are some common treatments that may be offered:

                                     </span><br> 
                                     Doctors can give medicines to help balance hormones and stimulate ovulation 
                                     in women who are having trouble getting pregnant.</li><br>

                                     </span><br> 
                                     During this procedure, the doctor puts specially prepared sperm directly into 
                                     the woman's uterus to increase the chances of getting pregnant.</li><br>

                                            IVF is a more advanced treatment where eggs are taken from the woman's ovaries and combined 
                                            with sperm in a lab. The fertilized eggs are then placed back into the woman's uterus.</li><br>

                                                This is a special type of IVF where a single sperm is injected directly into 
                                                an egg to help with fertilization. It is used when there are issues with

                                                        These procedures involve transferring eggs and sperm or fertilized embryos into

                              When you're ready to have a baby, it's a good idea to schedule a 
                              preconception counseling appointment with your healthcare provider 
                              or midwife. This appointment usually takes place about three months 
                              before you start trying to conceive.<br><br>
                              During preconception counseling, your provider will review various 
                              aspects of your health and your partner's health. They will ask 
                              about your medical history, including any chronic health conditions 
                              you have and medications you're currently taking. It's important to 
                              get any medical conditions under control before getting pregnant. 
                              You should also inform your provider about any previous surgeries 
                              or complications in past pregnancies.
                               <br><br>Your family medical history will also be assessed to see 
                               if there are any genetic conditions that could be passed on to your 
                               child. Some genetic disorders can be identified through blood tests 
                               before pregnancy, so it's important to talk to your doctor about 
                               genetic screening.<br><br>Your vaccine status will be checked to 
                               ensure you're up to date on important vaccines like rubella and 
                               varicella. Getting these vaccines during pregnancy can be risky, 
                               so it's best to have them at least a month before trying to conceive. 
                               It's also recommended to stay up to date on your annual flu vaccine, 
                               which is safe during pregnancy.
                               <br><br>If you've been exposed to viruses like Zika, Dengue or COVID-19, 
                               it's important to inform your provider as these infections can have 
                               serious health risks for both you and your baby.<br><br>
                               Lastly, your provider may screen for intimate partner violence (IPV). 
                               This involves asking about any physical, sexual, or emotional abuse 
                               caused by a current or former partner. Identifying IPV is important 
                               for your well-being and safety.
                               <br><br>By discussing all these aspects, preconception counseling 
                               helps ensure that you and your partner are in good health and prepared 
                               for a healthy pregnancy and baby.

                                            A Pap smear is a test to screen for cervical cancer. It involves collecting a sample

                                                They will measure your weight, check your blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature,

                                     lean proteins, and low-fat dairy. Avoid processed and fatty foods. Limit your caffeine

                                Dealing with fertility challenges can be emotionally draining

                                To manage stress and anxiety, it's helpful to establish healthier strategies. 
                                Setting limits on ovulation and pregnancy testing can reduce anxiety. 
                                Engaging in activities unrelated to pregnancy, such as pursuing hobbies 
                                or spending time with loved ones, can provide a welcome distraction. It's 
                                also essential to focus on gratitude and appreciate the positive aspects of life.

                                    <span style="font-size: large;">Early pregnancy symptoms can include a missed period, fatigue, 
                                        raised basal body temperature, heightened sense of smell, tender and swollen breasts, 
                                        spotting (implantation bleeding), changes in cervical mucus, frequent urination, mood 
                                        swings, bloating, heartburn, nausea (morning sickness), food aversions, and excess saliva.
                                        <br><br>These symptoms can occur before a missed period, but not everyone experiences 
                                        all of them, and some may not have any symptoms until later in pregnancy. <br><br> 
                                        Some early signs of pregnancy include a rise in basal body temperature, increased 
                                        sensitivity to smell, breast changes, fatigue, implantation bleeding, changes in 
                                        cervical mucus, frequent urination, mood swings, bloating, heartburn, and morning 
                                        sickness.<br><br> It's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by 
                                        other factors, so the only way to confirm pregnancy is through a home pregnancy test 
                                        or a blood test conducted by a doctor. <br><br> Home pregnancy tests typically detect 
                                        the hormone hCG in your urine, which is produced by the placenta after implantation. 
                                        For accurate results, it's best to wait until your period is expected or slightly 
                                        later to take the test. <br><br> If you suspect you might be pregnant, it's a 
                                        good idea to schedule an appointment with your OB/GYN for confirmation and to 
                                        start prenatal care.</span>
