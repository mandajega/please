                              Exercising regularly before and during pregnancy is important for a healthy pregnancy and birth. 
                               It reduces the risk of problems like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. Being active helps 
                               you stay strong for labor and makes it easier. Experts, like the American College 
                              of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend that women who are pregnant or 
                              planning to get pregnant should be physically active. Regular exercise helps 
                              prepare your body for pregnancy by toning muscles, including the heart. It reduces 
                              stress, improves sleep, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight during 
                              pregnancy can lead to complications. thus, exercising can help you loose weight and improve 
                              your fertility. It's a good idea to start a fitness routine before 
                              getting pregnant, but it's never too late to begin. Exercise during pregnancy reduces 
                              the risk of complications and eases common symptoms. It also benefits the baby's brain 
                              development and heart health. If you and your partner start being active now, it can become a 
                              healthy habit for your family. You don't need expensive gyms or strict plans. Just find 
                              activities you enjoy, like walking or swimming, and make them a part of your everyday life. 
                              Being active doesn't have to be complicated; it's about finding ways to stay active in simple 
                              ways. Remember to consult with a doctor for guidance.</p><br>

                                should do depends on your current level of activity. If you have always been moderately 
                                active, you can continue exercising at the same level during pregnancy. If you exercise 
                                vigorously most days, you may need to reduce the intensity if you're having trouble 
                                getting pregnant. If you haven't been active before, start slowly and gradually 
                                increase your activity level. Experts recommend that women 
                                who are trying to conceive should aim for a moderate exercise routine of at least 
                                150 minutes per week. This means doing about 30 minutes of exercise most days. 
                                Remember, even three 10-minute sessions can be as beneficial as one 30-minute 
                                workout. Apart from traditional exercises like aerobics, strength training, and 
                                yoga, any activity that gets your heart pumping, such as gardening or housework, 
                                is good for your body and future baby. Also remember to listen to your body and 
                                stop when you feel you can't do any more.</p><br>

                                        Both walking and running are great cardiovascular exercises. However, be mindful of 
                                        your intensity and avoid activities that may increase the risk of injury. Stick to

                                            Weight lifting with lighter weights and higher repetitions or bodyweight exercises 
                                            like lunges, squats, crunches, and push-ups can help build muscle tone and bone

                                                Pilates, barre, and yoga:  </span><br>
                                                These exercises can improve strength, balance, endurance, 
                                                and muscle tone. Yoga, in particular, can help with relaxation, 
                                                which is important during the conception process. However, be

                                If you're feeling extremely tired, irritable, experiencing muscle or joint pain, 
                                    or having trouble sleeping, it may be a sign that you're exercising too much. 
                                    Whether you're pregnant or not, pushing yourself too hard can increase the risk 
                                    of injury. It's important to listen to your body and reduce the frequency, intensity, 
                                    or duration of your workouts if you experience these symptoms. Additionally, if your 
                                    menstrual cycle becomes irregular, it's a good idea to consult with your doctor, as 
                                    it can affect your chances of getting pregnant. Taking care of yourself and finding 
                                    a balance in your exercise routine is crucial for your overall well-being and fertility.</p><br>

                                                If not, simply go for a walk wherever you can instead of sitting at your desk.</li><br>

                                If your BMI is below 18.5, it means you may be underweight. 
                                Being underweight can have various reasons, and one of them 
                                might be exercising too much and not eating enough to replenish 
                                the energy used during exercise.<br><br>
                                Vigorous exercise is when you work out so hard that you can't 
                                speak more than a few words without pausing for breath.<br><br>
                                Exercising excessively and losing too much body fat can affect 
                                your fertility by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs) and 
                                may cause difficulties in getting pregnant. It can also pose health 
                                risks during pregnancy if you have a low BMI.<br><br>
                                If you're having trouble getting pregnant or experiencing irregular 
                                periods, it may be helpful to reduce the intensity of your exercise 
                                and engage in moderate-level activities. Additionally, make sure to 
                                eat enough food to compensate for the energy you use during exercise.

                                Most women who engage in intense exercise and have a normal 
                                or healthy BMI are not affected by infertility and can continue 
                                their exercise routine during pregnancy and beyond. However, a 
                                small number of women who do vigorous exercise regularly and 
                                have a low or healthy BMI may experience fertility issues, 
                                especially if they have irregular or missed periods.<br><br>
                                Intense physical activity can cause stress on the body, which 
                                can disrupt the hormones responsible for regulating your 
                                menstrual cycle. This can lead to irregular periods or even 
                                the absence of periods.<br><br>
                                If you're struggling to get pregnant or have irregular periods 
                                and engage in vigorous exercise, it may be helpful to reduce 
                                the intensity of your workouts to a moderate level. It's also 
                                important to ensure you're eating enough to replace the energy 
                                used during exercise.<br><br>
                                If you've been trying to conceive for a year without success, 
                                or if you're not having regular periods, it's recommended to 
                                consult your doctor. They may refer you to a specialist for 
                                further tests or treatments.

                                There isn't enough evidence to suggest that excessive exercise 
                                directly causes infertility in men. However, if your partner 
                                is very active and concerned about fertility, he may be advised 
                                to reduce his exercise level. It's important to note that other 
                                factors are more likely to contribute to fertility issues.<br><br>
                                Regular exercise is still important for your partner's overall health. 
                                Being inactive increases the chances of being overweight, which can 
                                affect the quality and quantity of sperm in men.<br><br>
                                Both you and your partner can support each other in adopting a 
                                healthier lifestyle as you prepare to have a baby together.
